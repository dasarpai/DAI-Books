Download Fonts from http://www.gaurangapada.com/fonts.zip

Unzip the above zip file after downloading and you will find three folders. Diacritic fonts for the PC, Sanskrit fonts for the PC and Diacritic font for the Mac. Extract these font folders from the zip file with your unzip program. Then install the appropriate fonts for your OS by going to Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> Fonts -> File -> Install New Font...and browsing to the extracted folders, selecting the fonts and clicking ok. Or you can directly copy the appropriate fonts to your windows\fonts folder through windows explorer and they should get installed.

Some text in the Gaurangapada Vanibase is in the universal Times New Roman font but some of the original verses and translations from the Vedic scriptures are in the Diacritic ScaGoudy or Balaram or Tamal font. So we request you to install all the fonts for your OS.  PC users should not install the font Balaram.sitx which is a font for the Mac and in Mac fonts folder. Mac users can install only this font in their Mac OS.
