Troubleshooting : 
 
Windows Vista and Windows 7 users may experience problems of chm getting blocked and unable to run saying that the web page was unavailable.

To solve the problem, Right click the file --> Select Properties --> and Click the unblock button at the lower right --> Apply --> Ok

Usually that option may not be available. To solve that problem, users should copy the chm to a USB drive with non-NTFS format (like FAT 32). Right click the file in the USB drive --> Select Properties --> If the Archive box is checked, please UNCHECK it --> Apply --> Ok.

Then delete the file in the hard disk and after that copy the file from the USB to the hard disk -- it will work now.

For further details, it is highly recommended to see the pdf file attached in this RAR that goes into actual details.
